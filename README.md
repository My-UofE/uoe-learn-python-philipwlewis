# Programming in Python

This repository has been set up as a space that you can use while studying the Programming in Python lecture series taught by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter.

The content is divided into ten sessions voering different topics in Python programming and software development. 

 - The **`LECTURES`** folder is a space where you can add code and notes as you follow the lectures. 
 - The **`WORKSPACE`** folder is a space where you can complete coding activities.
 - The **`RESOURCES`** folder is where you can download and store reference materials.

 The lecture and workspace folders have been set up with sub-folders for each session to help you to organise your work. For students working in CodeSpaces you must note that this is a temporary space, and you must push all your work to the permenant storage in the GitHub repository using the Source Control panel as described in the module introduction.
